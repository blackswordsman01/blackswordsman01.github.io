          More than 75 different prehistoric species come to life in Jurassic
          World Evolution 2, including highly requested flying and marine
          reptiles, and returning community-favourite dinosaurs. These majestic
          creatures feel more alive than ever as they preside over territory,
          and display brand-new behaviours when interacting with each other,
          fighting for dominance, and reacting intelligently to the world around
          them. Players can use bioengineering to customise their dinosaurs with
          bold new colours and pattern colours, and alter their genomes to
          unlock different traits.
